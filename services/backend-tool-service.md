# Backend Tool Service — Detailed Design

> **Status: Future Implementation**
> The Backend Tool Service is optional and planned for Phase 3. It is not required for Phase 1 or Phase 2. All tool execution in Phase 1 and Phase 2 happens locally via the Local Tool Runtime.

**Phase:** 3 (optional)
**Repo:** `backend-tools`
**Bounded Context:** ToolExecution

---

## Purpose

The Backend Tool Service provides remote-only tool execution for capabilities that cannot or should not run locally on the desktop. It complements the Local Tool Runtime rather than replacing it — local tools remain local, and only tools that require backend infrastructure (e.g. cloud database access, remote build systems, secure vault operations) run here.

---

## Responsibilities

- Execute remote-only tools on behalf of the Local Agent Host
- Store tool outputs as artifacts in the Workspace Service
- Emit telemetry and audit events for remote tool invocations
- Enforce capability checks for `BackendTool.Invoke` capability

---

## What the Backend Tool Service Does NOT Do

- It does not replace the Local Tool Runtime — file, shell, and network tools continue to run locally
- It does not execute tools on behalf of the LLM directly — the Local Agent Host routes tool calls; the Backend Tool Service is one possible destination
- It does not manage the agent loop — it is a stateless execution service called by the Local Agent Host

---

## Relationships

| Called by | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Local Agent Host | Execute remote-only tools when `BackendTool.Invoke` capability is granted |

| Calls | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Workspace Service | Upload tool output artifacts |
| Telemetry Service | Emit tool execution traces |
| Audit Service | Record high-risk remote tool invocations |

---

## When to Use Remote Tools

A tool runs in the Backend Tool Service instead of Local Tool Runtime when:

- The tool requires cloud infrastructure not available on the client machine (e.g. cloud database queries, remote build systems)
- The tool requires elevated permissions that should not be granted to the local desktop process (e.g. production secrets access via a vault)
- The tool produces large outputs that should go directly to the Workspace Service without routing through the desktop
- The tenant policy explicitly requires certain tool categories to execute in a backend sandbox rather than locally

The capability `BackendTool.Invoke` in the policy bundle specifies which remote tool names the session is allowed to invoke.

  participant LocalAgentHost as Local Agent Host

  participant BackendToolService as Backend Tool Service
  participant WorkspaceService as Workspace Service
  participant TelemetryService as Telemetry Service

  LocalAgentHost->>LocalPolicyEnforcer: Check BackendTool.Invoke capability
  LocalPolicyEnforcer-->>LocalAgentHost: Allowed
  LocalAgentHost->>BackendToolService: POST /tools/{toolName}/invoke
  BackendToolService->>TelemetryService: Emit tool_requested event
  BackendToolService->>BackendToolService: Execute tool
  BackendToolService->>WorkspaceService: Upload output artifacts
  WorkspaceService-->>BackendToolService: artifactUris
  BackendToolService->>TelemetryService: Emit tool_completed event
  BackendToolService-->>LocalAgentHost: Tool result and artifactUris
```

## API Endpoints

### POST /tools/{toolName}/invoke — Invoke Remote Tool

Called by the Local Agent Host when the LLM requests a tool that maps to a remote-only backend tool.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "sessionId": "sess_789",
  "taskId": "task_001",
  "stepId": "step_004",
  "workspaceId": "ws_456",
  "toolName": "CloudDbQuery",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending'",
    "connectionName": "prod-readonly"
  }
}
```

**Response:** `200 OK`
```json
{
  "toolName": "CloudDbQuery",
  "sessionId": "sess_789",
  "taskId": "task_001",
  "stepId": "step_004",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "outputText": "Row count: 142",
  "artifactUris": [
    "workspaces/ws_456/artifacts/art_789"
  ]
}
```

**Error response:**
```json
{
  "toolName": "CloudDbQuery",
  "sessionId": "sess_789",
  "taskId": "task_001",
  "stepId": "step_004",
  "status": "failed",
  "error": {
    "code": "TOOL_EXECUTION_FAILED",
    "message": "Database connection timeout"
  }
}
```

---

### GET /tools — List Available Remote Tools

Returns the list of remote tools available for the current tenant configuration.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "toolName": "CloudDbQuery",
      "description": "Execute read-only queries against configured cloud databases",
      "inputSchema": { "$ref": "CloudDbQueryInput" },
      "requiresCapability": "BackendTool.Invoke"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Tool Result Schema

Remote tool results use the same `ToolResult` schema as local tools:

```json
{
  "$id": "ToolResult",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["toolName", "sessionId", "taskId", "stepId", "status"],
  "properties": {
    "toolName":    { "type": "string" },
    "sessionId":   { "type": "string" },
    "taskId":      { "type": "string" },
    "stepId":      { "type": "string" },
    "status": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["succeeded", "failed", "denied"]
    },
    "outputText":  { "type": "string" },
    "artifactUris": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": { "type": "string" }
    },
    "error": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "code":    { "type": "string" },
        "message": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["code", "message"],
      "additionalProperties": false
    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

Using the same `ToolResult` schema as the Local Tool Runtime means the Local Agent Host processes results from both local and remote tools identically.

---

## Data Store

The Backend Tool Service is **stateless** — it does not own a database. All session context is passed per-request by the Local Agent Host.

Tool configurations (e.g. database connection strings, API keys for remote tools) are tenant-scoped and injected at runtime via environment variables or a secrets manager (e.g. AWS Secrets Manager). They are never stored in a service-owned database.

Large tool outputs are written directly to the Workspace Service's S3 bucket — the Backend Tool Service holds no artifact state of its own.

---

## Implementation Notes

- The Backend Tool Service is stateless — it does not maintain session state. All session context is passed per-request.
- Each tool implementation is responsible for uploading its own large outputs to the Workspace Service. The tool result carries `artifactUris` rather than embedding large payloads in the response body.
- Tool implementations must be tenant-aware — tool configurations (e.g. database connection strings) are scoped per tenant and never cross tenant boundaries.
- The `BackendTool.Invoke` capability in the policy bundle specifies an allowlist of tool names. The Backend Tool Service must verify that the requested `toolName` appears in the session's capability grant before executing.
